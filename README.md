# ASP.NET MVC WEB PROJECT
In this project, we created an web site using the MVC structure. The user who is registered to the system in the project, can vote from the votings on the site (provided that each user votes 1 in 1 voting). Additionally, users can list the results of the available votes by category. When admin, another user of the system, logs into the site, it is directly directed to the admin panel. Via the admin panel, on "voting, categories, users" on the system can be "adding, editing, deleting" processes in connection with the database.
